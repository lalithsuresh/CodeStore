CodeStore
---------

A peer-2-peer object store based on self-repairing codes (SRC).

It works with a central master server that takes an object
and distributes it across a set of peers by splitting the
object into multiple parts using the SRC.

In its current form, peers are local directories and the basis
vectors for the SRC are to be fed as a configuration parameter.
It has been tested against a (5,2) PSRC code for now. Hopefully,
the same code works with other codes as well. :)


Running the code
----------------

$: ./split.py <file-to-be-split>


TODO
----
- Support remote peers.
- Peers should talk to each other for node repair.
- Support joining of a new node.
