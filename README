CodeStore
---------

A peer-2-peer object store based on self-repairing codes (SRC).

It works with a central master server that takes an object
and distributes it across a set of peers by splitting the
object into multiple parts using the SRC.

In its current form, peers are local directories and the basis
vectors for the SRC are to be fed as a configuration parameter.
It has been tested against a (5,2) PSRC code for now. Hopefully,
the same code works with other codes as well. :)

Python 2.7 is required to run the application

Running the code
----------------

$: ./menu.py 

Commands
---------
Once inside the prompt there are several commands to execute
    
    (Cmd) init Filename
    Splits the file into parts by applying the basis vectors and the xor operations where needed.
    It also starts a monitor service which takes care of regeneration
    
    (Cmd) regenerate Filename FailedNode node1 node2 [node3]
    Regenerate using 2 or 3 nodes (if possible). 
    To reconstruct using 2 nodes, we use the basis vectors to solve a sys of linear equations.
    Thus, we determine which parts to pull from the nodes, and how to combine them for regenerate the missing objects
    When using 3 nodes, by looking at the basis vectors of the Failed node, we can determine which bit is not set. 
    If this is possible then, we can regenerate by using only 3 vectors from 3 different nodes in the list, given these vectors do not have the missing bit set in them.
    Only when it is not possible to find these vectors, we fall back and reconstruct by using 4 parts from 2 nodes.
    
    (Cmd) reconstruct Filename node1 node2
    We reconstruct the object by fetching 4 parts from 2 nodes and finding the inverse of the matrix formed by the basis vectors of the nodes.
    The output file generated is 'reconstructed-output.mp3'
    
    (Cmd) test Filename
    Tests all possible combinations of the regenerate function using 3 nodes to reconstruct. It shows that in 58% of the cases it is possible to reconstruct using 3 nodes
    by using the our method of detecting the unused bit in the failed node.

    (Cmd) stats
    Print stats from the monitoring service that detects the failure of nodes

    (Cmd) clean Filename
    Clean all parts corresponding to that file from the directories and also delete 'reconstructed-output.mp3'

    (Cmd) exit
    Exit the shell
    
TODO
----
- Support remote peers.
- Peers should talk to each other for node repair.
- Support joining of a new node.
